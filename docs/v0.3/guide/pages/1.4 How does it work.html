The proxy does two things:
<ol>
<li>Publishes session instances returned by the openSession methods via the event broker.</li>
</ol><p class="paragraph"/> 2. Intercepts calls to getCurrentSession and delegates them to an instance of CurrentSessionContext we have initiated with a reference to the SessionFactory <strong class="bold"></strong>proxy<strong class="bold"></strong> instead of the actual object. This is great because it allows us to support webflows without introducing a compile time dependency to the webflow plugin.
