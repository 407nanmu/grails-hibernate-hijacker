h3. From other plugins

One way is to add an doWithEvents closure to the plugin description file (...GrailsPlugin.groovy). 
See Hawk Eventing's documentation for other ways of subscribing to events. 

{code:java}
def doWithEvents = { ApplicationContext ctx ->

    hibernate.sessionCreated { Event event -> 
        // Do something with the session (event.payload)
    }
    
}
{code}
